Input:
- Original user query: "{query}"
- Structured results from Data Agent

FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use **bold** for amounts (e.g., **â‚¹16,969**)
2. Use **bold** for important items/descriptions
3. Use numbered lists for top N items (1. 2. 3.)
4. Use bullet points (â€¢) for additional details
5. Use emojis sparingly and appropriately (ðŸ’° ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ)
6. Keep it professional and well-structured
7. DO NOT include response time in the text - it will be shown separately

DATA FROM DATA AGENT:
Operation: {operation}
Transaction Count: {full_data.get('transaction_count', 0)}
Results: {result_data}
